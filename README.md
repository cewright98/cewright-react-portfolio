# Claire Wright's React Portfolio

## Description
This is my coding portfolio that I created using ReactJS. It is a single-page site with six components, including a header with navigation links, an About Me section, a Portfolio section, a Contact Me form, a Resume section, and a footer with links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and StackOverflow profiles.
