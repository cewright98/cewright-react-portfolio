        Hi! My name is Claire Wright and I am a web developer currently enrolled in the UNC Coding Boot Camp. 
        Back in 2020, I graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a double major in Political Science and Women's and Gender Studies.              
        Although I am now primarily focused on coding, I would love to incorporate this interdisciplinary background into a web development role.
        Throughout my time at the UNC Boot Camp I have developed skills primarily in JavaScript. 
        I am experienced with frameworks such as Node and React, as well as with databases including MySQL and NoSQL.
        I am also very comfortable working with tools like jQuery, Bootstrap, and Git.
